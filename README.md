# Smart Sales Data Analyzer

## Overview

Smart Sales Data Analyzer is a beginner-level Python project built to practice **data analysis, visualization, and automated reporting**.

The program processes a raw CSV sales dataset, cleans the data, identifies trends, generates charts, and automatically compiles the results into a structured PDF report.

This project was created as a **learning exercise while developing practical Python and data analysis skills**, focusing on tools commonly used in real-world workflows such as pandas, matplotlib, and automated reporting.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate the ability to:

- Clean and process real datasets
- Perform basic business-oriented analysis
- Generate visual insights
- Automate report creation with Python

---

## Features

- Data cleaning (remove duplicates and missing values)
- Sales trend analysis
- Automatic chart generation
- Summary metrics calculation
- Multi-page PDF report generation

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- fpdf2

## How It Works

### 1. Data Processing

`main.py` reads the dataset and performs:

- Data cleaning
- Date conversion
- Grouping and aggregation

### 2. Visualization

Charts are generated using **matplotlib**:

- Monthly sales trend
- Sales by category
- Sales by region
- Top selling products

The charts are automatically saved in the `charts/` folder.

### 3. Report Generation

`generate_report.py` creates a **multi-page PDF report** using **FPDF2**.

The report includes:

- Report title
- Generation timestamp
- Summary statistics
- Visual charts

## How to Run

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib fpdf2
```

### Run analysis

```bash
python main.py
```

### Generate report

```bash
python generate_report.py
```

The final report will be saved to:

```
output/sales_report.pdf
```

---

## Example Output

The generated PDF report includes:

- Sales summary metrics
- Monthly sales trends
- Regional sales distribution
- Category sales comparison
- Top performing products

> **Note:** Charts are generated when you run `main.py`. The `charts/` folder will be populated after the first run.
